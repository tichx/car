## üéØ Feature Importance Analysis

### Top Predictive Features:

1. **`is_hypercar`** (30.2% importance) - Whether car is P1/Senna/Speedtail/F1/Elva/Sabre
2. **`age_squared`** (25.9%) - Non-linear depreciation relationship
3. **`age`** (20.6%) - Primary depreciation factor
4. **`year`** (10.8%) - Model year significance
5. **`model_encoded`** (3.3%) - Specific model variant

### Key Insights:
- **Hypercar classification is the strongest predictor** - premium models command significantly higher prices
- **Age has non-linear impact** - newer and very old cars have different value patterns
- **Mileage is less important than expected** - brand prestige dominates over usage

## ‚è∞ Time Series Validation Results

**Time-based validation** (more realistic for future predictions):
- **XGBoost**: MAE $244,477 (¬±$161,413) - **MOST STABLE**
- **Random Forest**: MAE $845,972 (¬±$1,269,228)
- **Gradient Boosting**: MAE $929,330 (¬±$1,423,952)

**Conclusion**: XGBoost performs best for **future price prediction** despite being 3rd in cross-validation.

# Load trained model
evaluator = McLarenPriceEvaluator.load_model()

# Predict price
result = evaluator.predict_price(
    year=2020, 
    model='720S', 
    mileage=5000, 
    state='CA'
)

print(f"Predicted Price: ${result['ensemble_prediction']:,.0f}")
